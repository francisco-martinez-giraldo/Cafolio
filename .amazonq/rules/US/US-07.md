## Task: Add New Preparation / Cupping

**Context:**  
User can add a preparation/cupping to a brand, registering how the coffee was brewed and evaluated.

**Goal:**  
Record detailed preparation data and a rating for the coffee.

**UI:**

- Form fields:
  - Method (dropdown, fixed list)
  - Temperature (dropdown, fixed values)
  - Ratio (dropdown, fixed values)
  - Grind (dropdown, fixed values)
  - Notes (text, optional)
  - Date (auto-filled, not editable)
  - Rating (slider or dropdown, 0.0 to 5.0 in 0.5 increments, required)

**Logic:**

- All select fields are fixed/predefined (no editing or adding in MVP).
- Notes can be left empty.
- Date is set automatically to now.
- Rating must be 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 5.

**Validation:**

- All fields except notes must be filled.
- Rating must be within allowed values.
- Save is only possible when required fields are filled.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Cannot save unless all required fields are selected/filled.
- If invalid value for rating, show error.
- On save, preparation is linked to brand and appears in list.
