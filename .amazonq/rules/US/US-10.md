## Task: Navigation and Validation

**Context:**  
Users must follow a clear, linear navigation flow, and all required fields must be validated at each step.

**Goal:**  
Ensure robust user experience and data integrity.

**UI:**

- Linear navigation: Login → Home → (Brand/Add Brand) → (Brand Detail) → (Add Preparation).

**Logic:**

- Cannot proceed if validations fail.
- Show meaningful error messages.
- Show success confirmation on save.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Cannot proceed to next step unless all validations pass.
- All error/success states are clearly communicated.
