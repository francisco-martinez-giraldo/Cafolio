## Task: Home Screen â€” Show Last 3 Used Brands

**Context:**  
After login, the user lands on the Home screen. The main focus is showing the three most recently used coffee brands, with an option to add a new one.

**Goal:**  
Quickly access recent coffee brands and start a new preparation or add a new brand.

**UI:**

- Three cards for the latest 3 coffee brands, each showing:
  - Brand name
  - Brand image
- "Add New Brand" card/button always visible.

**Logic:**

- Brands are sorted by most recently used (last preparation date or creation date).
- If fewer than 3 brands exist, show empty states or placeholders.
- Clicking a brand opens the Brand Detail screen.
- Clicking "Add New Brand" starts the Add Brand flow.

**Validation:**

- If no brands exist, show only the "Add New Brand" option.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The 3 most recently used brands are always shown first.
- Tapping any brand navigates to its detail view.
- "Add New Brand" is always present.
